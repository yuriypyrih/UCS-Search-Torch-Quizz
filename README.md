# UCS-Search-Torch-Quizz

## Story
Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. 
They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. 
Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 8 minutes. 
When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question is, 
can they all get across the bridge if the torch lasts only 15 minutes?

## Uniform-Cost search
Uniform Cost Search is the best algorithm for a search problem, which does not involve the use of heuristics. 
It can solve any general graph for optimal cost. Uniform Cost Search as it sounds searches in branches which 
are more or less the same in cost.
 
 **This algorithm does not find the best solution!**
